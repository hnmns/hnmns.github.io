I am Riley.

I will be graduating from the MS in Computational Analysis and Public Policy (MSCAPP) program at the University of Chicago in June of 2026. MSCAPP is a joint program between the Department of Computer Science and the Harris School of Public Policy. Previously, I studied math and statistics, doing exploratory data analysis on stability properties of certain ecological dynamic models.

### I would be delighted to work for a(n)...
* Local, county, state government
* Port authority
* Public service commission
* Consumer advocacy board
* Advocacy nonprofit

in the northwest USA, or even around Chicago.

### A handful of topics here in the US that get me *Riled* up...
* **Wealth inequality** (trying to look into stuff like alleged millionaire "tax flight" and the scary prospect of a sales tax in Montana)
* **Maritime shipping** (I [interned with the Great Lakes Governors and Premiers](/posts/gsgp_internship_post/))
* **Rate-regulated electric utilities** (e.g. why investor-owned utilities misbehave)
* **Election and government reform** (e.g voting systems, replacing the Electoral College, the political-industrial revolving door)
* Whatever my first job entails

### If you please, take a gander at my resume.

### A handful of (other) things I find pretty neat...
* **Mathematical biology**: Computational neuroscience especially; learning about the [Hodgin-Huxley model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin%E2%80%93Huxley_model) for the first time felt like such a neat overlap of physics, math, and bio
* **Some video games**: I'm always drawn to cool emergent gameplay, particularly in games with co-op, skill trees / specialization, and physics.  *Barotrauma* is probably the archetypal game for what I mean.
* **Melon Fanta**: Not watermelon, but melon (honeydew). Not ramune, but Fanta.
* **Spanish language**: There's something about learning vocabulary that's so inherently fun, and some way or another I find grammar pretty neat too. It's just a matter of actually speaking and listening now...

I am Riley.

I would be delighted to work for a(n)
* Local, county, state government
* Port authority
* Public service commission
* Consumer advocacy board
* Advocacy nonprofit

in the northwest USA, or even around Chicago.

I've got a fire in my belly for a handful of topics here in my home country (the USA):
* Wealth inequality (trying to look into stuff like alleged millionaire "tax flight" and the scary prospect of a sales tax in Montana)
* Maritime shipping (I interned with the [Great Lakes Governors and Premiers](https://gsgp.org/))
* Rate-regulated electric utilities (e.g. interconnection queues, why investor-owned utilities misbehave)
* Wherever my first job takes me

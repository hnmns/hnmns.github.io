		<h3>Longmen (mythology)</h3>
        <p>
			In Chinese mythology, Longmen (lit. The Dragon Gate) is located at the top of a waterfall cascading from a legendary mountain. 
			The legend states that while many carp swim upstream against the river's strong current, few are capable or brave enough for 
			the final leap over the waterfall. If a carp successfully makes the jump, it is transformed into a powerful dragon. 
			The legend is so famous that throughout China, a common saying is that "a student facing his examinations is like a carp 
			attempting to leap the Dragon Gate."
        </p>

		<h3>Legends (Using "bdo" right to left tag)</h3>
		<p>
			<bdo dir="rtl">
            According to tradition, a carp that could swim upstream and then leap the falls of the Yellow River at Dragon Gate (Longmen) 
			would be transformed into a dragon. This motif symbolizes success in the civil service examinations. The Dragon Gate is located at 
			the border of Shanxi and Shaanxi where the Yellow River flows through a cleft in the Longmen mountains, supposedly made by Yu the Great, 
			who cut through the mountain.

			According to one account, forceful water brought many carp down the river, and the carp could not swim back. 
			The carp complained to Yu the Great. His wife, the Jade Emperor's daughter, explained to her father on behalf of the carp. The Jade Emperor promised that if those carp could leap over the Dragon Gate, then they would become mighty dragons. Thus, all the carp competed at a yearly competition to leap the Longmen falls; those who succeeded were immediately transformed into dragons and flew off into the sky.[3]

			Pictures of carp attempting to leap the Longmen falls have been enduringly popular in China and other parts of Asia. 
			There are other Dragon Gates (Longmen) in China's rivers, typically with steep narrows, and the mythological geography does not depend upon an actual location. 
			Many other waterfalls in China also have the name Dragon Gate and much the same is said about them. Other famous Dragon Gates are 
			on the Wei River where it passes through the Lung Sheu Mountains and at Tsin in Shanxi Province. The "flying carp" or "silver carp" 
			(Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) is native to China and other parts of Asia.

		<h3>Idiom</h3>
		<p>
			The fish's jumping feature is set in such a proverbial idiom as "Liyu (Carp) jumps over the Dragon Gate" an idiom that 
			conveys a vivid image symbolizing a sudden uplifting in one's social status, as when one ascends into the upper society or has found
			favor with the royal or a noble family, perhaps through marriage, but in particular through success in the imperial examination. 
			The idiom is often used to encourage students or children to achieve success through hard work and perseverance.
        </p>

		<h3>Mount Longmen (Shanxi)</h3>
		<p>
            Longmen Shan is where the Yellow River abruptly leaves the vast, rugged expanse of the Loess Plateau that spreads out in 
			the mountain's north and west to enter a plain which connects both to the nearby Linfen Basin in the east and to the Guanzhong
			 Plain further southwest. The mountain is thus a part of the Loess Plateau's southern edge. At the same time, it forms the 
			 south-western extreme point of the Lvliang Mountains, a range that runs parallel to the river as it flows south.

			The spot at Longmen Shan's southwestern tip where the Yellow River breaks through is called Yumenkou (pinyin: Yumenkou, "Yu's doorway, or gate"). 
			Here, three bridges span the Yellow River. As there are no 
			other nearby bridges either upstream or downstream, this is the only dry connection from Xiangning County and Hejin (in Shanxi province) 
			across the river to Hancheng (in Shaanxi province), hence the name Xiang-Han Yellow River Bridge(s).

			From Yvmenkou, Longmen Shan stretches in a straight northeasterly direction and then slightly bends eastward toward its opposite end, 
			where a ravine (pinyin: Qingshi Yu) breaks through to the plain, separating Longmen Shan from the rest of the Lvliang Mountains.

		<h3>Yu (Yv) the Great</h3>
		<p>
            Yu the Great was a legendary king in ancient China who was famed for his introduction of flood control, his establishment of the 
			Xia dynasty which inaugurated dynastic rule in China, and his upright moral character. 
			He figures prominently in the Chinese legend of "Great Yu Who Controlled the Waters" (pinyin: Da Yu Zhi Shui).
			The dates which have been proposed for Yu's reign predate the oldest-known written records in China, the oracle bones of the late 
			Shang dynasty, by nearly a millennium. Yu's name was not inscribed on any artifacts which were produced during the proposed 
			era in which he lived, nor was it inscribed on the later oracle bones; his name was first inscribed on vessels which date 
			back to the Western Zhou period (c. 1045-771 BC).

			<blockquote>
			The lack of substantial contemporary documentary evidence has caused some controversy over Yu's historicity. 
			Thus, proponents of his existence theorize that stories about his life and reign were orally transmitted in various 
			areas of China until they were eventually recorded during the Zhou dynasty, while opponents of it believe that the 
			figure existed in legend in a different form-as a god or a mythical beast-during the Xia dynasty, and morphed into a 
			human figure by the start of the Zhou dynasty. Many of the stories about Yu were collected in Sima Qian's famous Records of the Grand Historian. 
			Yu and other "sage-kings" of Ancient China were lauded for their virtues and morals by Confucius and other Chinese teachers.
			</blockquote>

			Yu is one of the few Chinese monarchs who is posthumously honored with the epithet "the Great".
